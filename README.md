# sohophotoarchive
This is an archive of prints and exhibitions by members of the SohoPhotoGallery in NYC

I built it to understand the MEAN fullstack development process and is based largely on this book by Simon Holmes:

It is deployed here (the details of each photographer are secured behind a login):
